# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis - Determine number of employees eligible for retirement 

## Deliverable 1:

    1.  The objective of Deliverable 1 is to determine the number of current PH employee, by title, that are eligible for retirement.
    2.  The PH employees born between 1 Jan 1952 and 31 December 1955 are deemed eligible for retirement at PH.
    3.  The first query in the Employee_Database_challenge.sql file extracts the title history for each retirement eligible employee.
    4.  The second query extract the most recent title for each retirement eligible employee. 
    5.  The third query extracts a count for all titles of the retirement eligible employees.

## Deliverable 2:

    1.  The objective of Deliverable 2 is the produce a table of employees, born between 1 January 1965 and 31 January 1965, that are eligible for the mentorship program. 
    2.  The fourth query extracts table with the employee numbers, first names, last names, birth dates, employment dates, and titles for potential mentorship candidates.

## Summary

    1.  PH has over 50,000 engineers that are currently retirement eligible (see retiring_titles.csv and retiring_titles.png in Data directory).
    2.  I also ran 3 additional queries to determine the number and title of the current employees that were born between 1 January 1956 and 31 December 1979 and that are NOT retirement eligible. This list shows that PH has over 138,000 engineers currently on staff that are NOT eligible for retirement (see retaining_titles.csv and retaining_titles.png).
    3.  PH will still have an engineering staff of over 138,000 remaining AFTER the 50,000 retirement eligible engineers take retirement.
